    "Your CPU has multiple cores, but that still wouldn't mean that it would run Hogwarts Legacy at max settings, but eh, it can atleaast run code in parallel. Many codes and algorithms in astronomy can be categorized as \"embarrassingly parallel\", meaning that they can easily be split up into multiple tasks that each have little or no dependency on each other. An example of this is running the same image processing steps on multiple files, or computing the likelihood of a bunch of different sets of models. \n",

    "Parallelilization adds extra complexity to the code, making it harder to debug and maintain. And you don't want that when you're already stressed about thinking what to come up to tell your advisor. Thus, it is important to consider the relative gain of implementing parallelization versus the extra effort in developing and maintaining that code. For this reason, we also recommend that you keep parallelization code as simple as possible. For many tasks, even the most simple parallelism is sufficient. \n",

    "### Checking Resource Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime you are testing parallelized code, it is good to monitor your CPU/RAM usage. Monitoring your CPU usage can help you assess if the number of processes being run in parallel is consistent with what you are looking for. Many times, running parallelized code already involves big data sets, and parallelization will use even more memory (you can think of it as trading runtime for memory usage). So have your resource monitor up occasionally when you are developing this code. It is also a great way to debug the code (e.g., identify hanging parallelization that is not finishing). \n",
    "\n",
    "We create a function with an argument `index` that tells each process what chunk of the task to run. We then create a bunch of processes, give them their chunks, and call `start()` to run them. Afterwards, our master process uses `join()` to wait for each process to finish. It is important to always call `join()` at the end to ensure all processes have finished running! If a process has finished immediately, `join()` will immediately return; if a process has not finished, our master process will sleep until the process it is waiting on has finished. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Before we begin with multiprocessing, a few important points:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Only one process can spawn other processes. Your subprocesses cannot spawn their own subprocesses! Generally, there is always a way to program things so that only one process needs to spawn subprocesses\n",
    " * While python is generally OS-agnostic, you may run into OS specific issues with multiprocesses due to the fact it is implemented a bit differently for Linux, Mac, and Windows. \n",
    " * One key difference to remember when developing packages for multiple OSes: on Mac and Windows, any lines with multiprocessing calls need to be wrapped in something like ``if __name__ == \"__main__\"``, otherwise you will get an error mentioning something about `freeze_support()` when trying to run it. This is not required in Jupyter notebooks, so we have merely commented where you would need them here. The details for why this is necessary is related to subprocesses not spawning their own subprocesses and is quite technical, but [here is a related blog post if you want to learn more](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/python-multiprocessing/). \n"

    "<img src='parallel_memes.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do you really need parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "We already emphasized this above, but parallelism adds complexity. Try avoiding parallelization until it is necessary. If some code takes 10 minutes to run, but you only need to run it once per week, is it worth parallelizing? The programming and upkeep costs may not be worth it. Parallelism also makes it hard to debug: we cannot attach the python debugger on other Python processes meaning they often crash with no error message as to why. GNU Parallel (below) is an alternative to writing more complicated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GNU Parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a script that you want to run multiple times (e.g., on multiple files), you don't need to write Python parallelization. We can use the `parallel` package that can be installed on UNIX systems to handle the parallelization. For example, if we can process a single file by running on the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python process.py file_01.fits\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can run it on `file_01.fits` to `file_99.fits` by running on the command line:\n",

    "    parallel python process.py ::: file_{01..99}.fits\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threads vs Processes\n",
    "Python has two parallelization modules: `multiprocessing` and `multithreading`. What's the difference? Why do we only use `multiprocessing`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads and processes are both tasks that your computer CPUs run in parallel. Threads share the same memory, whereas processes do not. Processes have to communicate between each other using shared variables (see below) or via a slower I/O method (writing to files, communicating over websockets). Most languages use threads to parallelize computations because sharing the same memory is very convenient and saves on resources. However, Python has the \"Global Intepreter Lock\" (GIL) that allows only one thread to run at a time (for complicated consistency reasons). Generally, parallelism in astronomy involves computationally intensive tasks so only one of them being able to run at a time would defeat the purpose. That's why you will generally only see multiprocessing in astronomy-related software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads are more frequently seen outside of astronomy, but it is generally useful for \"I/O bound tasks\" as opposed to the \"CPU bound tasks\" that we usually encounter in astronomy. Anytime you have tasks with a lot of sleeping/waiting time such as if you have multiple web API queries (e.g., multiple database queries) or waiting for files to be created, threads are a better choice because they use less memory and they can access all of your variables instead of having to define shared variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one notable exception is that `numpy` functions that call C code releases the GIL. This means if your code is dominated by `numpy` matrix operations such as dot product, then you can actually use threads with minimal increase in runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shared Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes do not by default share memory. For processes to read/write/access the same variables, we have to declare shared memory. Python `multiprocessing` provides nearly all shared memory structure that you should be using: queues and arrays. Queues allow for interprocess communication. Arrays allow for large datasets to be accessed by multiple processes without needing to duplicate them (possibly saving a lot of memory usage). Use these special arrays and queues becasue they are automatically synchronized between processes and do not require synchronization code, which is generally low-level synchronization that we should avoid programming unless we absolutely need it. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in most applications, you will find you won't need to do this at all because each task will operate on a separte chunk of data. We did not need to use it in any of the examples seen in this notebook.\n"
