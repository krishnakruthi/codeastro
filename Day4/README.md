# Day 4

## Project Goal:

The final stretch! Document your code, add tests, release it, and get ready to present tomorrow!

Example: We’ll write docstrings for a couple core classes and functions (all we have time for) and add a tutorial to our README. We’ll write unit tests that evaluate the performance of key functions (e.g. if a user sets a degree range keyword, does the Gaia query work appropriately?), and end-to-end tests that make sure the whole package is working. We'll put our code on PyPI and try pip installing it on each of our machines to work through installation problems.

## Learning Objectives

  * Write tests based on anticipated use cases of your code
  * Actively avoid discrminatory behavior when coding
  * (Optional) Identify what parts of your code take the longest to execute.
